<h1>Mixing Paddling With Web Design</h1>
<br>
During my travels as a competetive outrigger paddler, I've met some pretty great people and made some pretty dope friends. Fortunately, I was lucky enough to become the close friend of a representative of a canoe building company called ARE Tahiti Outrigger. When he heard that I was working as a developer he asked if I could revamp the company's old website, the old one being a creaky wordpress site on its last legs. I promptly accepted. Any chance to combine my passion for web development and paddling seemed totally golden, so I got to work right away. I was asked to make the new site load quickly, do a better job of displaying content compared to the old site, and look good on any screen size. Right away, I knew React and Tailwind we're going to be the perfect tools to give ARE Tahiti the ultimate web makeover. Here's what I built:

<h1>How It's Made:</h1>
<br>

**Tech Used:** Adobe XD, React JS, Framer Motion, Tailwind CSS
<br>
<p>I started by building out prototypes in Adobe XD, working with my friend to find the exact look he was searching for. The new website needed to be sleek and modern and we wanted to make sure the canoes we're at the forefront of the design. Keeping this in mind I came up with a minimalist design, using thin lines and liberal amounts of whitespace. The finished design was both stunning to look at and easy to navigate through. My friend was satisfied so I fired up VS Code and started banging out some lines.</p>
<br>
<p>Using React, I was able to quickly scaffold out the project and with Tailwind speeding up the process, styling the page was a breeze. I tried to keep the number of complex components to a minimum, keeping in mind that my client was looking for fast load times. Some of my favorite components include the canoe cards and the checkout form. There's just something so satisfying about beautiful boats sliding into view on the page. Framer Motion came in clutch, making it easy for me to quickly animate the components on my page without any complicated configuration. I made sure not to overdo it, since too much animation on a page can often be cofusing and disorientating.</p>
<br>
<p>On the individual canoe pages, I used a few more framer motion components to animate in the features for each of the boats. While the pictures of the boats are interesting, I liked the idea of using a little bit of motion to really draw the user's attention to important photos and bits of information.</p>
<br>
<p>Keeping with the simple and modern theme, I stuck to simple order form plugged into Vite. Aside from that form, the rest of the site was just more Framer Motion components tactically placed to keep the visuals interestings. Another thing the client asked me to prioritize was mobile compatability and Tailwind's responsive classes made optomizing the site for small screens a breeze. Load times were lightning fast across all platforms and functionality transitioned smoothly across all screen sizes. Now the website was loading quickly, I was able to add in some nice, high-res photos of the boats. And as a final sidenote, all copy and images were produced by yours truly.</p>
<br>
<h1>Areas To Improve</h1>
<br>
<p>The new website is leaps and bounds ahead of the dusty old piece of wordpress history it was replacing, but there are still a few areas I think could be improved on. Since the website is relatively simple, the aformentioned improvements are mostly cosmetic but still important. Starting with the contact and order forms, their layouts are a bit cluttered and I feel that maybe a wizard would have done better in place of a form. The inputs could be split apart and spaced out nicely and the whole component would take up less space. I also think the About page could use a bit more visual variety, especially in the top section. A parallax scroll effect placed over a background image would make the page much more interesting to look at. Since I used Framer Motion, implementing a parallax scroll effect would be relatively easy to build and give the page the visual flare it's missing.</p>
<br>
<h1>Lessons I Learned</h1>
<br>
<p>Through building this site I had got to experience what it's like to design a product focused page. From day one, the goal was always to find better ways to show off the boats and that presented some unique challenges and learning opportunities. Figuring out how to design a product that not only functions well, but also looks nice is always a challenge and the product showcasing aspect only made the design process that much more importatnt. This was my second time working with Framer Motion components and I really enjoyed using the library to spice up my page designs. Similar to a game of chess, I had to make sure that I was placing my components in the right spots so I didn't clutter up the screen too much, or take anything away from the products on screen.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, this was a great opportunity for me to experience developing a product with constant feedback. Throughout the design and build process, I regularly checked in with my client to make sure that he was happy with the way that things were moving. Dealing with the process of constantly iterating through design and implementation is something I hadn't experienced with personal projects, mostly since this time, I wasn't the only person I had to please. In the end, I think I gained valuable experience learning how to move quickly between design and execution and also how to balance out my client's expectations with my own capabilities.</p>
